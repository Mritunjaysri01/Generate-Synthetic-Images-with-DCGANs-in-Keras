# Generate-Synthetic-Images-with-DCGANs-in-Keras
In this hands-on project,Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is used to
build and train a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images 
of fashionable clothes.In this project i used Keras Sequential API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend.

# Key Concepts
Understand Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs)
Design and train DCGANs using the Keras API in Python
